                Spirometry is a non-invasive test that measures how much air you can breathe in and out of your lungs. Bronchoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that uses a thin, flexible tube with a camera to examine the inside of your airways. These procedures are often used together to diagnose and treat respiratory conditions such as asthma, COPD, and lung cancer.

    **Specialized Medical Procedures Offered:**

    ---

    **Joint Injections**
    - Targeted delivery of medication directly into a joint to alleviate pain and inflammation, often used for conditions like arthritis or other joint disorders.

    ---

    **Spirometry/Bronchoscopy**
    - Comprehensive lung assessments with spirometry measuring lung function and capacity, while bronchoscopy provides a direct view of the airways to diagnose and treat various respiratory conditions.

    ---

    **ECGs (Electrocardiograms)**
    - A non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of the heart, helping to identify irregular rhythms, heart attacks, and other cardiac problems.

    ---

    **Screening Procedures**
    - Preventative tests and exams designed to detect potential health issues before they become serious. Includes checks for cancers, heart conditions, and more.

    ---

    **Minor Surgeries**
    - Outpatient procedures that address various conditions, requiring minimal incisions and often allowing for faster recovery times compared to major surgeries.
